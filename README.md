# MACHINE-LEARNING-PROJECT

PROBLEM DEFINATION

Determining whether the listed price of a used car is a challenging task, due to the many factors that drive a used vehicleâ€™s price on the market. The focus of this project is developing machine learning models that can accurately predict the price of a used car based on its features, in order to make informed purchases. We implement and evaluate various learning methods on a dataset consisting of the sale prices of different makes and models across cities in the United States. Our results show that Random Forest model and linear regression yield the best results, but are compute heavy. Conventional linear regression also yielded satisfactory results, with the advantage of a significantly lower training time in comparison to the aforementioned methods.

DATASET
We have found suitable datasets required for our project in Kaggle website. The data set is about the various features regarding for a car price such as brand,price,mileage,fuel type,year of purchase etc.., The data sets are being used for various type of car brands and various type of fuel such as petrol,diesel,CNG etc..,
